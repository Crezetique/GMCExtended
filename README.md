# GMCv2 Extended

This repository contains a simple plugin which extends GMCv2 in various ways, with utilities and such provided by GMC licensees.

(Mostly it exists because Packetdancer got tired of answering how to copy the trajectory movement component into Blueprint projects, and her solution was "just turn it into a plugin".)

There will be better documentation here eventually. Probably.
